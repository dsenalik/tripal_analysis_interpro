This module provides a method for loading XML results from the InterProScan program and make those results visible on gene or transcript content types in [Tripal](http://tripal.info). The module can load InterProScan XML v4 or InterProScan XML v5 generated from the command-line or web-based versions of InterProScan. Additionally, GO terms mapped by InterProScan can optionally be assigned to features.

# Installation
Instructions for installation and usage are currently found in the [Tripal v3 User's Guide](https://tripal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/example_genomics.html).
